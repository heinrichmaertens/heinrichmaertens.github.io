Software engineering is a multidimensional field that incorporates various elements from coding to managing projects. Amid this extensive field, two topics that yield broader applicability are coding standards and ethics in software engineering.

## Coding Standards

Coding standards, also known as coding conventions, are sets of guidelines designed to standardize the way code is written by developers. In essence, they dictate how code should be structured and formatted and may encompass aspects like naming conventions, indentation styles, comment usage, and guidelines for using advanced language features.

At first glance, coding standards might seem to primarily deal with aesthetics or 'readability' of the code. But peel a layer, and you'll find that coding standards play a vital role in improving software quality. They enhance code maintainability, reducing the risk of errors, making debugging easier, and facilitating better collaboration among developers.

While web application development may present its unique set of standards like adhering to HTML and CSS guidelines, coding standards are ubiquitous - they extend to all kinds of software development. A developer working on embedded systems or writing a machine learning algorithm can benefit from the universality of coding standards.

## Ethics in Software Engineering

While coding standards address the ‘how’ aspect of software engineering, ethics are concerned with ‘should’. They encompass the moral obligations that developers have when designing, developing, and deploying software. It involves making decisions that honor principles like user privacy, data security, and fairness.

A powerful piece of software has the potential to influence lives in significant ways, positively or negatively. This awareness introduces the need for ethical considerations, which don't just exist in a vacuum but are tightly interwoven within all aspects of software development.

For instance, consider the development of an AI-based facial recognition system. Here, ethical considerations must guide decisions related to algorithmic bias, respect for privacy, and intended and potential misuse of the technology. These decisions are not confined to just this sector, but carry over into virtually every use-case of software engineering.

## To Conclude 

While coding standards and ethics might seem worlds apart, under the lens of software engineering, they intersect significantly. Adhering to coding standards displays professional ethics, respects the efforts of future maintainers, and promotes a collaborative environment. On the other hand, ethical considerations can manifest themselves in coding practices, such as ensuring data privacy by avoiding insecure code constructs. 

The journey of learning and applying these principles extends far beyond the confines of web application development or any specific development environment. They form a significant part of the professional identity of developers and navigate their contribution to the digital world.
