In today's technologically advanced era, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives, transforming traditional methods across varied sectors, including education. In my journey through ICS 314, I've had the privilege to engage with cutting-edge AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot, especially within the context of Software Engineering.

Utilizing AI in different aspects of ICS 314, including homework assignments, in-class WoDs, and more, has generally resulted in a positive outcome. For instance, during a WoD on functional programming, I solicited ChatGPT to construct a function based on a given instruction. Despite its imperfections, the resultant AI-produced code served as an invaluable stepping stone for refining specific codes further. The inclusion of AI as a supplementary resource indisputably heightened my understanding and promoted skill advancement. Whether tasked to decipher code or pinpoint its defects, AI proved to be an indispensable aide, enabling me to troubleshoot and rectify coding anomalies independently. Though traditional debugging could provide similar insights, it tends to be significantly more taxing time-wise.
In non-academic settings, AI's profound utility manifested strongly during group projects, such as our final project for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). With the ticking clock against us to develop a working prototype, AI empowered rapid iteration of new features, significantly outpacing conventional methodologies. Furthermore, if unfamiliar React codes were to be added, queries directed to the AI model often garnered faster and simpler solutions than perusing voluminous documentation. Despite this, I have occasionally found AI-generated answers lacking the precision imperative for specific coding assignments. Nonetheless, these instances were leveraged as unique learning opportunities to delve deeper into the subject matter. Currently, the main limitation I observe is the lack of a fully functional solution at the first request, reinforcing the necessity for understanding the inner workings of the code to tweak as needed. Precision in phrasing queries also seems to significantly affect the quality of output.

Conclusively, I found my engagement with AI-facilitated methods more stimulating and pragmatic compared to conventional teaching models, enriching my overall learning experiences in software engineering. Although instructor support was essential, their accessibility was limited consequently centring AI tools as my go-to resource. With the swift progression of AI technology, its substantial future role in software engineering education is undeniable. My experience with the integration of AI in ICS 314 was transformational, effectively augmenting both my problem-solving and coding competencies.
