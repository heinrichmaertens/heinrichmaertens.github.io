## Impressions of ICS 314 so far

By now, I have done 5 practice WODs - 3 during the TA’s office hours, and 2 for the homework problems. Most of them have been relatively easy for me as the concepts were not unfamiliar in most cases, and the Javascript language has a lot in common with others I have used. I am sure that they will continue to get more challenging, though, as the course progresses. I have also noticed that I should spend more time reading the desired outcomes of the code rather than jumping right in. For two of the WODs, I needed a couple extra minutes to complete them since I was building something slightly different from what I needed to. For example, for the Euler 1 homework, I was multiplying values that instead required to be added, trying to figure out why what I was doing was not working. I could have finished quicker if I had identified that difference before starting. Now, for none of the WODs so far, I have been close to the time limit, but I still think it also seems like a good practice to keep up regardless of what I am coding since it will save me from headaches later on. Having to rewrite code and debugging these issues is never fun. I also think that having to think about these problems rather quickly will help me better identify patterns in coding and know what makes sense to use. The situation isn’t relaxed enough to start trying various ideas, forcing you to evaluate and pick out the best choices quickly. 

## Thoughts on newer features with ES6

Overall, I quite like JavaScript since it is so similar in many regards to other languages’ formatting, making it easy to understand even if the specific implementation is somewhat unique. From the modules we have gone through thus far, I liked learning more about ES6. I have had some exposure to Javascript before, though I don’t think I ever understood the split between the more recent changes introduced to the language. I prefer using the newer JS ES6 format for function declarations, plus the destructuring assignments and spread syntax also seem quite nice to have. One of the downsides with the ES6 changes, at least initially for me, was that, especially with destructuring assignments and spread syntax, the code becomes a bit more abstract, requiring more knowledge to read correctly. It is no longer always apparent in all cases if you don’t have JS experience what a code block means; the language has become less verbose. However, I think the changes may still be worthwhile since they can significantly reduce complexity and the time it takes to program something.
