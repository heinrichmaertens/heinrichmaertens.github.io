##### Why standards exist

Coding standards are often seen as a necessary evil, as they are a valuable tool for any software team. By following coding standards, teams can produce high-quality code that is easier to maintain and debug. This can lead to reduced development costs, improved product quality, and increased satisfaction from collaborators.

Here are some of the key points addressed by coding standards:
- Readability: Coding standards make code easier to read and understand - they make it easier for developers to understand what the code does.
- Consistency: Conventions help to make code more consistent.
- Errors: A style guide can help to reduce errors in code.
- Risk: Finally, these best practices can help to reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and other defects in code.

All of this is significant because it simplifies developers' ability to maintain and debug code. New developers get up to speed on a codebase faster, streamlining collaboration on code. This can lead to reduced development costs and improved quality. Code analysis tools and other forms of automation used to improve code quality become easier to use. Developers can avoid common pitfalls and write code in a more consistent and reliable way, by avoiding common mistakes. Ultimately, we can write code in a more secure and reliable way.

##### Modern IDEs will do most of the heavy lifting for you.

Coding standards can be boring. They can seem tedious. While most people already agree on the importance of coding standards in large teams and tech stacks, many might debate following a specific style for smaller projects. Something to consider is that most modern IDEs have built-in support for coding standards. This means you can configure your IDE to format your code according to a specific coding standard automatically. This can save you a lot of time and effort and help ensure your code is always consistent with the coding standard. For big projects, this means that you’re spending less time formatting. For projects where there are fewer collaborators, this could make adding a coding style worthwhile where it might have otherwise not been. While it might have needed consideration in the past, it seems there is no longer a good case for not utilizing one of these programming conventions.
