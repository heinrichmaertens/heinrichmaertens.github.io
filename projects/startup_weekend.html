<h3 id="building-a-startup-idea">Building a startup idea</h3>

<p>My team, Stay-Lit, developed a creative solution to provide intermediate lighting to critical areas within hotels whenever primary light bulbs burn out or get damaged. This is a major safety issue, as it can take several days for these bulbs to be replaced. In the meantime, these areas are left dark and unlit, which can create a potential hazard for guests and staff.</p>

<p>Our solution is a network of sensors that monitor the status of light bulbs throughout the hotel. If a bulb burns out or gets damaged, the sensors will automatically trigger a backup lighting system to provide temporary illumination. This will allow the hotel to quickly fix the problem without having to leave the area dark and unsafe.</p>

<p>Our technology has the potential to be used in a variety of other settings where constant uptime is required, such as airports, hospitals, and schools. In these environments, even a brief power outage or light failure can have serious consequences. Our system can help to mitigate these risks by providing a backup lighting solution that can be activated quickly and easily.</p>

<p>We are excited about the potential of our technology to improve safety and security in hotels and other critical areas. We have developed a prototype and are currently testing it in real-world settings. We believe that our technology has the potential to save lives and prevent accidents.</p>

<p>These are all industries where multiple lawsuits that have been filed against service providers who have failed to fix broken lights, which resulted in accidents or crimes. The technology could help to prevent these accidents and crimes by providing a quick and reliable backup lighting solution.</p>
